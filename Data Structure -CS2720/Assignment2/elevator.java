/*Documentation:
 
   Purpose:
 * Write a program name elevator.java that simulates one elevator services in a 12-floor building. 
 * There is only one elevator working this building. The floors of the building are numbered from 1 to 12.
 * Elevator going up has 8 requests.
 * Elevator going down has 5 requests.
 * Fill out two Arraylist with random number as going up and going down elevator.
 * Each time you stop at a floor, you must stay there for 3 seconds.
 * (allowing the people to either enter the elevator or leave the elevator). 
 * Display this time in a counting format as well as an appropriate message. 
 * The elevator must take 2 seconds to move from one floor to another.
 * The direction in which the elevator is going must be known at all times and the floor to which it is going. 
 * Ask user if the user wants to run the program again and again.
 

 *First declare all the variables.
 *use random to fill out two arraylists(going up and going down).
 *create a method that sorts both arraylists(going up and going down).
 *In the main method display going up and going down arraylist with sorted going up and going down arraylist.
 *Create Multiple for loop and if loop to make functional elevator.
 *Create a new method to ask if the user wants to repeat the program.

 *for loop
 *arraylist
 *if statement
 *boonlean
 *Random 
 *Scanner
 *while loop
 *TimeUnit sleep

 *Description of how to use this program:
 *Run this program
 *If the user wants to repeat this program input "Y" or "y", then the program will be repeat.
